# SmokaEngine

SMoka Engine is aimed to a very simple yet powerful project structure. It provides C# API and XML (with C# written extensions).

## Why SMoka?
SMoka comes from Sharp Moka, and Sharp comes from C Sharp (C#). In the first engine, or try if you will, moka engine was
writen in C++, but after some time of coding, I decided to switch to Java, so JMoka was born (that project is still in
development), but now C# seems very interesting, so we'll switch again. Thats it!
